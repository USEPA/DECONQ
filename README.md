# DECONQ
VR Decontamination Questionnaire Game made for EPA's 2023 Decontamination Conference.

This demonstration presents a series of questions to the user based on the "Game Over is not an Option: The Applications of Serious Games to US Environmental Protection Agency's Emergency Response Mission" presentation. It functions as a short quiz of the presentation as well as a demonstration of the presentation's principles.

Unity Combined with Meta Quest 2 were used to create an immersive experience depicting a quiz aboard a floating pirate ship, as well as a short trip underwater.

To use, download the apk file from the most recent release and install it on your VR device. Originally designed on the Oculus Quest 2, not tested on other devices. 

To play, use the grip button on the controller to activate a laser pointer, and use the trigger button on the controller when pointing the laser pointer at clickable options to choose them. Select one of the four options to answer the question, and select the arrow to progress forwards. If you select the correct answers to the question presented, you can proceed to the next question. If you get one wrong though, you will walk the plank and end up in the depths below.
