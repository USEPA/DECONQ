# DECONQ
VR Decontamination Questionnaire Game made for EPA's 2023 Decontamination Conference.

This demonstration presents a series of questions to the user based on the "Game Over is not an Option: The Applications of Serious Games to US Environmental Protection Agency's Emergency Response Mission" presentation. It functions as a short quiz of the presentation as well as a demonstration of the presentation's principles.

Unity Combined with Meta Quest 2 were used to create an immersive experience depicting a quiz aboard a floating pirate ship, as well as a short trip underwater.
